<h2>Introduction</h2>

acs-person is a superset of person in the OpenACS system. It can
be used as a standalone module or to augment/replace person. 

<h3>Data Model</h3>
<a href="acs-persons-schema.jpg">Schema</a>
Changes from HR-XML 

<p>The HR-XML specification describes several optional,
multi-valued attributes. Since we aren&#39;t dealing with XML as
the native format several changes/compromises had to be made.</p>

<p>Certainly, multi-valued attributes could have been completely
normalized and been technically correct. It wasn&#39;t felt that
this was an efficient or proper use and in most cases only the
base table <code>acs_persons</code> will be used.</p>

<p>With that in mind here is a rundown of the differences from
the specification:<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>FamilyName is a 0=&gt;many attribute that also has an
attribute of primary. The purpose of this is to designate an
order when there are multiple family names. In acs-person, a map
table is created: <code>family_name_acs_persons_map</code>. This
creates an optional space for storing multiple family names. It
also includes a field called: <code>order</code>, which allows
for putting the family names in the correct order for multiple
family names. By default the family_name in the acs_persons table
will always appear first. The order field also allows for sorting
in the case of querys.</li>

<li>GivenName is a 0=&gt;many attribute. In acs_person, a map
table is created: <code>given_name_acs_persons_map</code>. This
creates an optional space for storing multiple given names. It
also includes a field called: <code>order</code>, which allows
for putting the given names in the correct order for multiple
given names. By default the given_name in the acs_persons table
will always appear first. The order field also allows for sorting
in the case of querys.</li>

<li>MiddleName is a 0=&gt;many attribute. In acs_person, a map
table is created: <code>middle_name_acs_persons_map</code>. This
creates an optional space for storing multiple middle names. It
also includes a field called: <code>order</code>, which allows
for putting the middle names in the correct order for multiple
middle names. By default the middle_name in the acs_persons table
will always appear first. The order field also allows for sorting
in the case of querys.</li>

<li>Affix is a 0=&gt;many attribute. In acs_person, a map table
is created: <code>affix_acs_persons_map</code>. This creates an
optional space for storing multiple affixes. It is linked to a
lookup table that def ines the valid <code>affix_types</code>.
This is complicated and may need additional thought as it is
really storing multiple unrelated attributes in one field. I
would not have modelled this like it is, but this is the standard
so I will leave it as is.</li>

<li>AffixType defines the context for the Affix and is a lookup
table. This is required if any Affixes are present.</li>
</ul>
